Hi Nikhil,

Thank you for your application for the Web Development Teaching Assistant (virtual) internship at Internshala and I am happy to inform you that your application has been shortlisted for the next round of evaluation. As the next step, I would like you to attempt the following assignment-

Design and develop a web application (in Bootstrap (mandatory) and core PHP (mandatory, do not use any PHP framework), which will be an internship portal similar to that of Internshala, but on a much smaller scale. 

- The application will have 2 kinds of users, student and employer.
- After registering, the employer should be able to post internships, with bare minimum details. Internship posting should be restricted only to an employer and a student as well as a non-registered user, should not be allowed.
- There should be a page which should display all the internships being posted on the application. This page should be accessible to everyone irrespective of whether the user is even logged in.
- A student should be able to apply to any internship he may want. If the student has already applied for an internship, he should be restricted from applying again. If the user is not logged in, it should redirect to the login page. And if the user is logged in as an employer, he should not be allowed to apply.
- The employer should be able to see all the application he has received for his internships.

Mainly, we want you to concentrate on the following things:

- Database design
- Good coding practices
- Very basic decent design

Deadline: Please submit the assignment latest by next Tuesday (24th September'19), 10:00 AM.

How to send: Host the assignment online (mandatory). There are various free hosting services available. Share the link with us in an email.
Also, please zip the assignment and send it by replying to this message (with .zip extension). Please make sure you include the sql file so that we can replicate your database.

Thanks
